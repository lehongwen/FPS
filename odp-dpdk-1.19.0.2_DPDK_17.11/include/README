ODP specification
=================

ODP specification consists of several types of files, which together provide
full list of types, values and functions that ODP implementation MUST provide.

ODP API specification
---------------------

These are the files from `include/odp/api/spec` directory. They specify a set
of function prototypes, types, type names, enumerations etc that MUST be
provided by ODP implementation. Doxygen comments inside these files document
requirements for ABI interface provided by an implementation. Content of some
types and value of some enumerations are left undefined in API spec. These are
defined either in ABI spec or implementation specific (non-ABI compatible)
headers .An implementation MUST use these headers AS IS, without any
modifications to be compatible with ODP specification.

ODP ABI compatibility specification
-----------------------------------

These are the files from `include/odp/arch/@ARCH_ABI@/odp/api/abi/` directory.
They specify a set of types and values that MUST be used AS IS without any
modifications by an implementation if it supports and is compiled for
ABI-compatibility mode.

ODP default ABI headers
-----------------------

These are the files from `include/odp/api/abi-default` directory. They provide
default specification for ODP types and values for ABI compatibility. CPU
architecture specific ABI compatibility files heavily depend on these headers.
These files MUST NOT be changed by an implementation.

odp_api.h header
----------------

This header found at `include/odp_api.h` is an entry point for an application.
Application MUST include only odp_api.h, nothing else. This file includes all
files from ODP specification.

Additional ODP headers
======================

These are the headers provided by an ODP to supplement ODP specification.

ODP API headers
---------------

These are the files from `include/odp/api` directory. They glue together API
and ABI specification headers. Although they are not part of ODP specification
itself, they provide an easy way for an implementation to use ODP API/ABI
header files.  An implementation SHOULD use these headers AS IS unless it has
strong reason not to do so.

Platform-specific headers
=========================

Platform ABI headers
--------------------

These are the headers found at
`platform/@with_platform@/include-abi/odp/api/abi` directory. They are used by
the rest of ODP code if implementation is compiled with ABI compatibility
disabled. They should implement at least a set of types and values documented
in ODP API specification headers. They are permitted to provide any platform
specific optimizations (i.e. they might provide types and/or values that map
directly onto the hardware details, they might provide inline functions to
speed up execution of the application, etc). These headers MAY use ODP default
ABI headers if they do fit.

Rest of platform-specific headers
---------------------------------

Platform MAY provide additional headers at `platform/@with_platform/include`.
However these headers SHOULD NOT be used directly by an application, because
this will tie it to the exact implementation details. Application MUST include
only <odp_api.h> header.  Platform ABI headers MAY use these headers to
implement platform-specific optimizations.
