== IPsec services

In addition to general cryptographic services, ODP offers offload support for
the IPsec protocol. IPsec is a general term referencing a suite of protocols
and packet formats and as such a full discussion of IPsec is beyond the scope
of this document. See https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4301[RFC 4301] and
related RFCs for more detail. This section assumes the reader is already
familiar with IPsec and focuses on explaining the ODP APIs that support it.

ODP provides APIs for the following IPsec services:

* General IPsec configuration
* Security Association (SA) configuration and lifecycle management
* Synchronous and Asynchronous IPsec lookaside processing
* Inline processing for full IPsec RX and/or TX offload
* Pipelining for RX traffic
* Fragmentation support for TX traffic
* IPsec event management

=== IPsec Capabilities and Configuration
As with other features, ODP provides APIs that permit applications to query
platform-specific IPsec capabilities. The `odp_ipsec_capability()` API queries
the general IPsec features available while the `odp_ipsec_cipher_capability()`
and `odp_ipsec_auth_capability()` APIs provide detail on the range of
cipher and authentication algorithms supported by IPsec on this platform.

General IPsec capabilities that are reported include:

* The IPsec operation modes supported by this implementation. Different
operation modes may be _not supported_, _supported_, or _preferred_. A
preferred form means that this mode takes advantage of hardware
acceleration features to achieve best performance.
* Whether IPsec AH processing is supported. All ODP platforms must provide
support for IPsec ESP processing, however since AH is relatively rare, it
may not be supported, or supported only via software emulation (_e.g.,_ be
non-preferred).
* Whether IPsec headers can be retained on decrypt for inbound inline
operations.
* Whether classification pipelining is supported (to be discussed below).

In addition, capabilities also inform the application of the maximum number
of destination queues and classification CoS targets supported. These
will be discussed further later.

==== IPsec Operation Modes
IPsec operates in one of three modes: Synchronous, Asynchronous, and Inline.

==== Lookaside Processing
Synchronous and Asynchronous are types of _lookaside_ processing. Which of
these forms may be used depends on the IPsec operation mode. So synchronous
APIs may only be used when operating in synchronous mode, and asynchronous
APIs may only be used when operating in asynchronous mode.

In lookaside mode, the application receives (or creates) an IPsec packet and
then uses ODP to perform one of two functions:

* To decrypt an IPsec packet into a "normal" packet
* To take a "normal" packet and encrypt it into an IPsec packet.

This process may be performed _synchronously_ with the APIs `odp_ipsec_in()`
(to decrypt) and `odp_ipsec_out()` (to encrypt). Upon return from these calls
the requested packet transformation is complete, or an error return code
indicates that it could not be performed (_e.g.,_ packet decryption failed).

Synchronous processing may be preferred if the application has a large number
of worker threads so that blocking any individual worker while IPsec processing
is performed represents a reasonable design. The alternative is to use
_asynchronous_ forms of these APIs:

* `odp_ipsec_in_enq()` for decrypt
* `odp_ipsec_out_enq()` for encrypt

These simply pass packets to IPsec for processing. When this processing is
complete, the resulting packets are sent to the completion queue associated
with the SA used by the operation, serving as IPsec completion events as
shown here:

image::ipsec-lookaside.svg[align="center"]

If the operation fails because SA lookup failed for inbound processing, then
these result packets are sent to the default queue specified as part of the
`odp_ipsec_inbound_config_t` used in the `odp_ipsec_config()` call.

Following an asynchronous IPsec call, the worker thread moves on to process
other events until the IPsec completion shows up. At that point the worker
thread sees whether the operation was successful or not and continues
processing for that packet. These events may be direct-polled with
`odp_queue_deq()` if the completion queue was created as a plain queue, or
processed via the ODP scheduler if the completion queue was created as a
scheduled queue.

==== Inline Processing
While lookaside processing offers flexibility, it still requires extra
processing steps not required by modern hardware. To avoid this overhead
ODP also offers _inline_ processing support for IPsec. In this mode the
processing of IPsec packets on the RX and TX paths is fully offloaded as
shown here:

image::ipsec-inline.svg[align="center"]

It is worth noting that, depending on the implementation and application
needs, inline processing may be enabled only for one direction (inbound or
outbound) or for both directions.

On the receive side, once configured for inline processing, arriving IPsec
packets that are recognized at the PktIO interface are decrypted automatically
before the application ever sees them. On the transmit side, the application
calls `odp_ipsec_out_inline()` and the packet is encrypted and queued for
transmission as a single operation without further application involvement.
Note that if an inbound IPsec packet is not recognized (_e.g.,_ it belongs to
an unknown SA) then it will be presented to the application as-is without
further processing. The application may then use a lookaside call to process
the packet if it is able to supply a matching SA by other means.

On the receive side, after an IPsec packet is decrypted, it may be
_pipelined_ to the ODP classifier or added to a poll queue, as the
application wishes. The advantage of classification pipelining is that inbound
IPsec traffic is automatically decrypted and classified into appropriate
flow-based queues for ease of processing.

On the transmit side, since IPsec encryption and tunneling may exceed an
output MTU, ODP also offers support for MTU configuration and automatic IPsec
TX fragmentation.

Both classification pipelining and TX fragmentation support are support
features that are indicated by `odp_ipsec_capability()`.

Note that at present inline IPsec output support sends resulting packets
directly to an output PktIO. If it's desired to send them to the ODP
Traffic Manager for shaping prior to transmission, use the lookaside APIs
to perform the IPsec encrypt and then call `odp_tm_enq()` on the resulting
packet.

=== IPsec Configuration
Prior to making use of IPsec services, the `odp_ipsec_config()` API is used to
configure IPsec processing options. This API takes a pointer to an
`odp_ipsec_config_t` struct as its argument.

The `odp_ipsec_config_t` struct specifies the inbound and outbound processing
modes (SYNC, ASYNC, or INLINE) that the application plans to use, the maximum
number of Security Associations it will use, and sets inbound and outbound
processing options.

==== IPsec Inbound Configuration
Inbound configuration options for IPsec specify the default `odp_queue_t` to
be used for processing global events like SA lookup failures, how Security
Parameter Index (SPI) lookup is to be performed, and whether the application
requires ODP to retain outer headers for decrypted IPsec packets.

Parsing options specify how "deep" decrypted packets are to be parsed
after IPsec processing by specifying the packet layers of interest to the
application (None, L2, L3, L4, or All). And which checksums should be verified
on decrypted packets.

==== IPsec Outbound Configuration
Outbound configuration options for IPsec specify checksum insertion processing
that should be performed prior to encryption.

=== IPsec Events
IPsec introduces one new event type and one new event subtype. These are:

* IPsec packet events. These are events of type `ODP_EVENT_PACKET` that have
subtype `ODP_EVENT_PACKET_IPSEC`. These are packets that carry additional
IPsec-related metadata in the form of an `odp_ipsec_packet_result_t` struct
that can be retrieved from the packet via the `odp_ipsec_result()` API.

* IPsec status notifications. These are events of type `ODP_EVENT_IPSEC_STATUS`
that indicate status events not associated with any particular IPsec
packet. Such events carry status in the form of an `odp_ipsec_status_t`
struct that is retrieved from the event via the `odp_ipsec_status()` API.

IPsec-related events are thus part of normal and exception processing when
working with IPsec.

=== Security Associations (SAs)
The fundamental "building block" for IPsec processing is the _Security
Association (SA)_. Similar to a crypto session, the SA encapsulates the keying
material and context needed to perform IPsec protocol processing for inbound
or outbound packets on a given flow, as well as additional processing options
that control how IPsec is to be used for packets processed under this
SA. Security Associations are unidirectional (RX or TX) so a flow that
requires both inbound (decrypt) and outbound (encrypt) IPsec functions will
have two SAs associated with it. SAs in ODP are represented by the
abstract type `odp_ipsec_sa_t`.

After ODP initialization, IPsec support is dormant until it is configured
by a call to `odp_ipsec_config()` as described earlier. Once configured,
SAs may be created by calling `odp_ipsec_sa_create()`.

==== SA Creation and Configuration
The `odp_ipsec_sa_create()` API takes an `odp_ipsec_sa_param_t` argument that
describes the SA to be created. Use the `odp_ipsec_sa_param_init()` API to
initialize this to its default state and then override selected fields within
the param struct as needed.

Items specified in the `odp_ipsec_sa_param_t` struct include:

* The direction of the SA (inbound or outbound).

* The IPsec protocol being used (ESP or AH).

* The IPsec protocol mode (Transport or Tunnel).

* The parameters needed for the crypto and authentication algorithms to be
used by this SA.

* Miscellaneous SA options that control behavior such as use of Extended
Sequence Numbers (ESNs), the use of UDP encapsulation, various copy
options for header fields, and whether the TTL (Hop Limit) field should be
decremented when operating in tunnel mode.

* Parameters controlling the SA lifetime.

* The Security Parameter Index (SPI) that packets will use to indicate that
they belong to this SA.

* The pipeline mode used by this SA.

* The destination `odp_queue_t` to be used for events associated with this SA.

* The user context pointer (and length) associated with this SA for
application use.

In addition, there are specific direction-specific parameters that vary
based on whether the SA is for inbound or outbound use. For inbound SAs:

* Controls for how this SA is to be looked up.

* The minimum size of the anti-replay window to be used.

* The default CoS to use when classification pipelining packets matching this
SA.

For outbound SAs:

* Tunnel parameters to use when doing outbound processing in tunnel mode.

* The fragmentation mode to be used.

* The MTU to be used to control the maximum length IP packets that outbound
IPsec operations may produce. This can be changed dynamically by the
`odp_ipsec_sa_mtu_update()` API.

As can be seen, SAs have a large degree of configurability.

==== SA Lifecycle Management
In discussing the lifecycle of an SA and the operations it supports, it is
useful to refer to the following sequence diagram for IPsec configuration, SA
management, and IPsec operations:

image:ipsec_sa_states.svg[align="center"]

After creation, IPsec services are active for this Security Association. The
specific APIs that can be used on this SA depends on the IPsec operating mode
that has been configured.

===== IPsec Lookaside Processing
If IPsec is operating in lookaside mode for the SA's direction (the
`odp_ipsec_op_mode_t` is `ODP_IPSEC_OP_MODE_SYNC` or `ODP_IPSEC_OP_MODE_ASYNC`),
then inbound or outbound lookaside operations may be performed. Asynchronous
lookaside operations are also permitted if the SA is operating in inline
mode, as described in the next section.

The synchronous forms of these APIs are:

* `odp_ipsec_in()`
* `odp_ipsec_out()`

Upon return from these calls, the return code tells the application the number
of number of input packets that were consumed by the operation. The result of
the operation is determined by calling the `odp_ipsec_result()` API for each
output packet to retrieve its associated `odp_ipsec_result_t`.

The asynchronous forms of these APIs are:

* `odp_ipsec_in_enq()`
* `odp_ipsec_out_enq()`

Here again, the return code indicates how many input packets were
processed. The success or failure is determined by inspecting the
`odp_ipsec_result_t` associated with each packet completion event. These are
presented as events of type `ODP_EVENT_PACKET` with subtype
`ODP_EVENT_PACKET_IPSEC`.

For both synchronous and asynchronous IPsec operations an input packet array
is transformed into an output packet array as specified by a controlling
parameter struct. For inbound operations, the `odp_ipsec_in_param_t` is
used to specify how SA processing is to be performed for the requested
operation. The caller may say that SA lookup processing should be performed
for each input packet, a single (specified) SA should be used for all packets,
or that each packet has a specified individual SA.

For outbound lookaside operations, a corresponding `odp_ipsec_out_param_t`
serves a similar role, but here the SA must be specified since the input
packet(s) are non-IPsec packets. Again the option is to use a single SA for
all input packets or one per input packet.

For outbound operations, an associated array of `odp_ipsec_out_opt_t` structs
is also used to control the fragmentation mode to be used as part of the
outbound processing. Options here are to not fragment, to fragment before
IPsec processing, after IPsec processing, or to only check whether IP
fragmentation is needed but not to perform it. For check processing, the `mtu`
status error bit in the `odp_ipsec_packet_result_t` is set if check processing
detects that the resulting packet will not fit into the configured MTU. Note
that the MTU associated with a given SA is set at SA creation and can be
changed at any time via the `odp_ipsec_sa_mtu_update()` API.

Once an asynchronous lookaside operation has been initiated, the worker thread
that issued the asynchronous call can handle other events while waiting for
the operation to complete. Completion of an asynchronous operation is
indicated by the worker receiving an `ODP_EVENT_PACKET` that has subtype
`ODP_EVENT_PACKET_IPSEC`. These events can be retrieved directly by polling
the completion queue associated with the SA, or (more typically) via the ODP
scheduler. Typical code for such completion processing would look as follows:

[source,c]
-----
while (1) {
	ev = odp_schedule(&queue, ODP_SCHED_WAIT);
	ev_type = odp_event_types(ev, &ev_subtype);

	switch (ev_type) {
	case ODP_EVENT_PACKET:

		switch (ev_subtype) {
		case ODP_EVENT_PACKET_IPSEC:
			pkt = odp_packet_from_event(ev);

			if (odp_unlikely(odp_ipsec_result(&result, pkt) != 0)) {
				/* Stale event, discard */
				odp_event_free(ev);
				continue;
			}

			if (odp_unlikely(result.status.all != ODP_IPSEC_OK)) {
				 if (result.status.error != ODP_IPSEC_OK) {
					 ...process error result
					 odp_event_free(ev);
					 continue;
				 } else {
					 ...process packet warnings
				 }
			}

			my_context = odp_ipsec_sa_context(result.sa);

			if (result.flag.inline_mode) {
				...process inline inbound packet
			} else {
				...process the async completion event
			}

			...
			break;

		case ...
		}
		break;

	case ODP_EVENT_IPSEC_STATUS:
		...process IPsec status event
		break;

	}
}
-----

===== IPsec Inline Processing
When IPsec is configured to operate in `ODP_IPSEC_OP_MODE_INLINE` mode,
inbound processing is implicit. The application never sees these packets until
after IPsec has already decrypted them. As shown in the code sketch above,
such packets appear as events of subtype `ODP_EVENT_PACKET_IPSEC` and the
`flag` field in the associated `odp_ipsec_packet_result_t` indicates
`inline_mode`.

For outbound IPsec processing, the `odp_ipsec_out_inline()` API operates as
a "fire and forget" API. A success return code from this call indicates that
the packet will be encrypted and transmitted to the `odp_pktio_t` indicated
in the `odp_ipsec_out_inline_param_t` specified at the time of the call without
any further application involvement. Only if a problem arises will the packet
be returned to the application with an `odp_ipsec_packet_result_t` indicating
the nature of the problem.

Note that while operating in inline mode, asynchronous lookaside operations are
also permitted. This provide the application with additional flexibility if,
for example, some packets need additional handling that cannot be supported
directly with inline IPsec processing.

==== SA Lifetimes
A fundamental principle of good security is that the keying material
associated with sessions has a limited lifetime. In effect, keys grow "stale"
over time or due to being used to encrypt too much data. The metrics used
to limit effective SA lifetimes are:

* Duration (time)
* Usage (volume of traffic using the keys)

Associated with each of these metrics are "soft" and "hard" limits. When a
hard limit is reached, the SA is expired and cannot be used further. To support
graceful transition to a replacement SA, soft limits are used. A soft limit is
similar to a "low fuel" warning light on a car. It alerts the application that
the SA is nearing the end of its useful life and should be renegotiated even
as the SA continues to work normally.

ODP support for SA limits is based on packet/byte counts. Applications that
wish to use time-based SA limits may do so on their own using the timing
facilities that ODP provides. However, since especially with inline IPsec
processing, the application may not have explicit knowledge of the traffic
volumes associated with a given SA, support for usage-based limits is
integrated into ODP IPsec support.

At `odp_ipsec_sa_create()` time, one of the fields in the
`odp_ipsec_sa_param_t` struct is the `odp_ipsec_lifetime_t` sub-structure.
This struct allows hard and/or soft limits to be specified in terms of total
bytes encrypted/decrypted, total packet count, or both. A limit specification
of 0 indicates no limit for that metric. If either is specified, the limit
is triggered on whichever occurs first. Given the defined behavior of hard vs.
soft limits, the soft limits, if used, should always be specified as lower
than the hard limits. These should be sufficiently lower to enable adequate
time to switch over to a replacement SA before the hard limit is reached.

As noted, when an SA hard limit is reached the SA immediately enters the
expired state and attempts to use it further are failed with an
`odp_ipsec_result_t` that indicates a hard expiration limit. When a soft
limit is reached for packets sent via `odp_ipsec_out_inline()`, this results
in an `ODP_EVENT_IPSEC_STATUS` event being sent to the application on the
queue associated with the SA that has reached the soft limit. This status
event has an `odp_ipsec_status_id_t` of `ODP_IPSEC_STATUS_WARN` with a
`odp_ipsec_warn_t` bits set to indicate the type of soft expiration reached.
Receipt of this event alerts the application that the SA is nearing the end of
its useful life and that it should be replaced. It is the application's
responsibility to heed this warning. It is implementation-defined how many
such warnings are issued when a soft limit is exceeded (once, first N packets,
or all packets beyond the limit), so applications should be written to
allow for possible repeated warnings.

When operating in lookaside mode, expiration limits are carried as a warning
in the `odp_op_status_t` section of the `odp_ipsec_result_t` struct. The same
is true for inline inbound packets. When the soft limit is reached, these
packets will carry a warning flag indicating this condition.

==== SA Disablement and Destruction
When it is time to retire an SA, the application does so by first issuing a
call to the `odp_ipsec_sa_disable()` API. This call initiates termination
processing for an SA by stopping use of the SA for new operations while still
allowing those that are "in flight" to complete processing. Following this call
the application continues to receive and process IPsec events as normal.

Disable completion is indicated by the application seeing an event of type
`ODP_EVENT_IPSEC_STATUS` for this SA that contains an `odp_ipsec_status_id_t`
of `ODP_IPSEC_STATUS_SA_DISABLE`. For inbound SAs, receipt of this event means
that the application has seen all IPsec packets associated with this SA that
were pending at the time of the disable call. For outbound SAs, receipt of
this event means that the application has seen all result events associated
with packets sent via this SA.

Note that once a packet has been "seen" by the application, it becomes the
application's responsibility to ensure that it is fully processed before
attempting to destroy its associated SA. The disable call exists to give
the application assurance that there are no pending IPsec events for this
SA associated with packets that it has not seen before.

So after disabling the SA, the application can process pending packets
normally until it sees the disable status event. At that point it knows that
all pending packets that arrived before the disable have been seen and it is
safe for the application to destroy it via `odp_ipsec_sa_destroy()`, thus
completing the SA lifecycle.
