    ODP L2FWD application

Source code and Makefiles placed under test/performance/ directory.

This L2 forwarding application can be used as example reference as well
as performance test for different odp modes (direct, queue or scheduler
with parallel, atomic or ordered queues).

Note that this example is tuned for performance. As a result, when using
scheduled mode with direct packet I/O output or queued output with multiple
output queues, packet order is not guaranteed. To achieve guaranteed order,
use a single worker thread or output interfaces with single output
queues. Other examples of scalable processing using ordered queues that
preserve order can be seen in the odp_pktio_ordered performance test.
