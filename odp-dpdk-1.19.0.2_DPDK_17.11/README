Main git repository:
    https://github.com/Linaro/odp.git

    How to build:
    Look in platform/linux-*/README for more detail how to build.
    Directory test contains test applications for ODP API calls and features support.

    For a list of build dependencies, read DEPENDENCIES.
    In general you can build:
    ./bootstrap
    ./configure
    Use 'make' to build ODP library and samples and 'make doxygen-doc' to build
    ODP API documentation. 'make install' will copy all required headers and
    binary files to the install directory.

    Configure options:
        ./configure --help

    To execute all the testcases, assuming CUnit is installed for the validation tests:
        ./bootstrap
        ./configure
        make check

    To generate the users guides:
        ./bootstrap
        ./configure --enable-user-guides
        make
